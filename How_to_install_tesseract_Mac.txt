Welcome to the OCR workshop!
Let’s get started!

Download the code (as zip file) from https://github.com/ektavats/OCR-tesseract-SE/tree/main
Save it on your laptop, working folder.
Copy some sample images in this folder, if any.

Follow these instructions for setting up the OCR code.


Mac OS:

1. Download anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Install anaconda (pkg file in Downloads folder, follow default options)
3. Open terminal
4. conda create --name pytess (press y, enter)
5. conda activate pytess
7. Install latest Python: 
 - brew install python3
8. Check if python is installed. In the terminal, type python3, press enter. Error? Type exit()
9. Install pip:
 - curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
 - python3 get-pip.py
10. pip install Jupyter lab
11. pip install pytesseract
12. Install tesseract: 
 - The easiest way to install Tesseract OCR on Mac is using Homebrew. 
 - If you don't have Homebrew installed, just go to Homebrew's site (http://brew.sh/), open your terminal, and run the Ruby script that is on the front page. 
- You may be required to type in your administrator password.
 - brew install tesseract
 - The tesseract directory can then be found using brew info tesseract (if needed)
 - e.g. /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tesseract/4.1.3/
13. In the terminal type: tesseract
 - Any error? If not, then we are good :)
 - Error (tesseract not found)? Add tesseract path to system environment. 
14. The English language is already included in this installation. If you want to install other language packs, just run the following command:
 - brew install tesseract --all-languages 
15. type: tesseract --list-langs 
 - can you see all the languages? 
- If not, restart the terminal and type the same command after: conda activate pytess
16. pip install matplotlib
17. pip install opencv-python
18. type: jupyter lab
19. select OCR_singleImage.ipynb. Run (two arrow buttons).



NOTE:
To run the code after the set up, or for future use:
1. Open the terminal
2. conda activate pytess
3. cd your/code/folder/path
4. jupyter lab

NOTE:
For details on more languages: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html
For adding more languages, simply use "swe + eng + deu" (e.g. Swedish, English, German.)


NOTE: select OCR_textExtractor, edit cell 14, if needed (throw errors):
